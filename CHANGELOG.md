# autocue changelog

### 2024-07-01 – v4.0.4

- Allow to override results via JSON even _after_ having done a fresh analysis (automatic or forced), for ultimate flexibility when using `cue_file` for pre-processing. You can now add fades, ramp or hook points, or do other calculations and feed the results into `cue_file` for tagging. **Use with care**, because some values are dependent on others. In any case, `cue_file` will ever _only_ write tags beginning with `liq_` and (if requested) `replaygain_`.
- Prevent some strange errors that could happen when piping something into `cue_file` and JSON input was not `stdin`. We now use `ffmpeg -nostdin` to prevent it reading input that was meant for `cue_file`.
- Don’t write _all_ `liq_*` tags (could have side effects), but only those _known_ (see `cue_file --help` for current list).
- Streamlined tag conversion code a little.

### 2024-06-18 – v4.0.3

- Changed default of `-x`/`--extra` and `settings.autocue.cue_file.overlay_longtail` from `-15.0` LU to `-12.0` LU, requested by @RM-FM and the community. Together with the `-d`/`--drop` default change from `60.0` to `40.0`, this makes for a "tighter" playout and doesn’t lose too much of long or sustained endings.
- Updated README and Presentation as well, to reflect the new default.


### 2024-06-16 – v4.0.2

#### Bug fixes, enhancements

- Allow recognition of values like `-8.33dB` (without blank before "dB") in `autocue.cue_file.liq` as well (it’s already in `cue_file`). **Note:** Metadata with units _should_ be used _with a blank in between_ value and unit.
- Streamline "sustained endings" code.
- Add some diagnostics output to `cue_file` on the console to easier find and fix problems:
  ```
  Overlay: -23.50 LUFS, Longtail: -38.50 LUFS, Measured end avg: -48.40 LUFS, Drop: 29.09%
  Overlay times: 336.50/348.50/0.00 s (normal/sustained/longtail), using: 348.50 s.
  Cue out time: 353.00 s
  ```
  Overlay times shown as `0.00` mean a calculation has not been done or wasn’t needed, like longtail above.
  Diagnostics are output to `stderr`, so don’t interfere with the JSON on `stdout`.
- **Changed default for "sustained endings" loudness drop** from `60.0`% to `40.0`%. This was a wish from the community and makes for a little tighter/denser song overlap.
- Modify to your liking by using `cue_file`’s `-d`/`--drop` parameter or `settings.autocue.cue_file.sustained_loudness_drop := 40.0` in Liquidsoap/AzuraCast. A value of `0.0` switches the "sustained endings" feature completely _off_ (behaviour like in older versions).


### 2024-06-15 - v4.0.1

- **Bug fix:** Catch index error in sustained ending calculation if we’re already at the end of the track. This could happen in very rare cases, if no earlier overlay start than the end of the track could be found.
- Added song that exposes this situation to the test set:
  - Camel - The Great Marsh


### 2024-06-14 - v4.0.0

#### New features

- **Even better transitions**, using _both_ "longtail" logic and the new "sustained endings" feature by @RM-FM, which we could even improve on, in a collaborative work. We are really happy with the results!

- Combined with the existing _blankskip_ handling (whose default is now 5.0 seconds instead of 2.5 s, to avoid false triggers), we are able to handle the **greatest variety of possible song endings with great transitions**. Be it a _cold end_, a _long fade_, a _trick ending_, an _unexpected noise, chord, riff or vocal at the end_ — we catch them all. Pure listening enjoyment!

- If you’re interested, here’s part of our testing set. Try it out for yourself!  
  **Songs with difficult endings:**
  - Beatles, The - Strawberry Fields Forever
  - Ben Folds Five - Underground
  - Black, Mary - Columbus
  - Darkness on Demand - Quicksand
  - Def Leppard - Let It Go
  - Electric Light Orchestra - Don't Bring Me Down
  - ella_henderson_rudimental_-_alibi_feat._rudimental
  - Global Deejays - Get Up (feat. Technotronic)
  - J.B.O. - Ein Fest
  - Nirvana - Something in the Way _ Endless, Nameless
  - Pink Floyd - Goodbye Cruel World
  - Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody
  - radiomonster.fm_-_dropin_01
  - R.E.M. - Losing My Religion
  - robbie_williams_-_angels
  - Stürmer, Christina - Ich lebe
  - test-5-15-5-15-5s
  - testfiles.txt
  - TLC - Waterfalls
  - Toto - Africa
  - Vega, Suzanne - Tom's Diner (vocals only version)
  - Walker, Tom - Leave a Light On
  - Who, The - Won't Get Fooled Again
  - Wonder, Stevie - Another Star

- New "sanity check" that (also) checks if your external `cue_file` and the Liquidsoap code have matching versions (a suggestion by John Chewter (@JohnnyC1951)), and shuts down otherwise. _After_ your settings, simply use this code:
  ```
  # Your settings go here...

  # Check Autocue setup, print result, shutdown if problems
  # The check results will also be in the log.
  # Returns a bool: true=ok, false=error. We ignore that here.
  # Set `print=true` for standalone scripts, `false` for AzuraCast.
  ignore(check_autocue_setup(shutdown=true, print=true))
  ```

#### Recommendation

- Always use the `check_autocue_setup` function _after_ your settings, in both standalone scripts and AzuraCast. It will not only check versions, but also set the crossfading duration to a correct value, based on your fade-out setting.

#### Breaking changes

- New informational boolean value `liq_sustained_ending` in `cue_file` result, file tags, and Liquidsoap metadata. It shows whether the "sustained endings" feature has been used to determine the "start next song" overlay point.

- Analysed timings shown on console, in case you manually tag a file or just want to check the results. This output don’t affect normal operation, it is done to `stderr`:
  ```
  Start next times: 257.50/261.30/0.00 s (normal/sustained/longtail), using: 261.30 s.
  Cue out time: 263.20 s
  ```


### 2024-06-12 – v3.0.0

#### New feature

- **Adjustable minimum silence length** for blank skipping, i.e., cueing out early when silence is found in the track, for instance from a long pause and "hidden tracks".
- A much requested feature many have been waiting for (including myself)!
- This new function adds _almost no extra CPU load_.
- Longer silent parts and "hidden tracks" will be _detected accurately_, without many false triggers, and the track cued out early, with a perfect transition.
- Long tail handling, overlay point detection (next song start) and fading stay active as before—they just work from the new cue-out point.
- The new cue-out point will be set _at the beginning_ of the specified and detected silent part. We don’t want to produce "dead air", after all.
- `cue_file` still supports the `-b`/`--blankskip` option, which will use a default of `2.5` seconds minimum silence duration.
- **Note:** If using _only_ `-b`/`--blankskip` _without a value_, you should use it as the _last parameter_ and then add a `--` before the filename, to signify "end of parameters". This is standard syntax and you probably know it already from other programs.  
  **Example:**
  ```
  $ cue_file -kfwrb -- "Nirvana - Something in the Way _ Endless, Nameless.mp3"
  ```
- You can add the desired duration after `-b`/`--blankskip` in seconds, it is a new optional parameter.  
  **Example:**
  ```
  $ cue_file -k -f -w -r -b 5.0 "Nirvana - Something in the Way _ Endless, Nameless.mp3"
  ```
- In Liquidsoap/AzuraCast, you can use this _setting_ which defaults to zero (`0.00`) and means "disabled":
  ```
  settings.autocue.cue_file.blankskip := 0.0
  ```
  **Don’t forget to change this setting** if you used `true` or `false` before!

#### Recommendation

- I recommend _not_ to use this feature on jingles, dry sweepers or liners, advertisements and podcast episodes. Especially spoken text can contain some pauses which might trigger an early cue-out.
- Nobody wants a podcast episode to end in the middle, or even risk losing ad revenue!
- You can easily prevent this and **turn off blank skipping**
  - by tagging a file with the `liq_blankskip` tag set to `0.00`,
  - by _not_ using `cue_file`’s `-b`/`--blankskip` option when writing tags,
  - by prefixing `annotate:liq_blankskip=0.00` on playlists.
  - An annotation has precedence over a file tag.
- In some special cases we **automatically turn off blank skipping:**
  - SAM Broadcaster: _Song category_ is _not_ "Song" (S). For all other categories like News (N), Jingles (J), Ads (A), etc. We look for the `songtype` tag here. This is useful if you use a common music library, or have files that have been tagged using SAM categories.
  - AzuraCast: _Hide Metadata from Listeners ("Jingle Mode")_ is selected for a playlist. This sets a `jingle_mode=true` annotation we honor.

#### Breaking Changes

- `liq_blankskip` is now a _float_, not a _boolean_ anymore!
- **Re-tagging recommended!** Sorry for that, but I hope the new functionality will outweigh the effort.
- Both `cue_file` and `autocue.cue_file.liq` will handle the "old" tags gracefully, using `0.00` for former `false` and your setting or the default of `2.50` s for former `true`.
- `0.00` (zero) now means "blankskip disabled".

### 2024-06-11 – v2.2.1

- Make JSON override switchable (`settings.autocue.cue_file.use_json_metadata`).
  Defaults to `true`.
- Minor code cleanup (thanks @vitoyucepi).

### 2024-06-11 – v2.2.0 (internal, unreleased)

- JSON override tags for cue_file in temp file: Allows passing annotate/database overrides to cue_file, to reduce re-analysis runs even more.

### 2024-06-09 – v2.1.0

- Prepare for third-party pre-processing software:
  - A JSON file (or stdin) can now be used to set or override any of the known tags (see help). Values from JSON override values read from the audio file’s tags.
  - This can be used, for example, to set values from a database (like AzuraCast’s cue and fade data from their Visual Cue Editor).
  - `cue_file` might _still_ decide a re-analysis being necessary, so it’s wise to re-consolidate the data after `cue_file` has returned its results.
- More robust variable reading from tags or JSON:
  - Booleans can be bool or string
  - Typechecking on tags with unit suffixes, especially `liq_true_peak`, which was a "dBFS"-suffixed string in v1.2.3 and now is a linear float.
- Added `liq_fade_in` & `liq_fade_out` to known tags. We don’t use these, but pre-processors might want to set them.
- More advance example in `test_autocue.cue_file.liq` that shows how annotations can be used to play 15-second snippets of songs.

### 2024-06-08 – v2.0.3

- Fix ffmpeg erroneously treating `.ogg` files with cover image as video. The `.ogg` filetype is now handled by Mutagen.

### 2024-06-05 – v2.0.2

- Show autocue.cue_file version number in Liquidsoap log on startup, to ease bug hunting. Your `cue_file` should use the same version.

The log entry looks like this:

```
2024/06/05 16:16:03 [autocue.cue_file:2] You are using autocue.cue_file version 2.0.2.
2024/06/05 16:16:03 [autocue.cue_file:2] Assure that the external "cue_file" has the same version!
```

### 2024-06-04 - v2.0.1

- Fix small bug when reading already stored `liq_true_peak` that contained a ` dBFS` value from v1.2.3.

### 2024-06-04 – v2.0.0

Version 2.0.0 is out! It offers the chance to write ReplayGain data to audio files, in addition to the Liquidsoap/Autocue tags.

This is useful for station owners that can’t or don’t want to use audio tracks that have been pre-replaygained. You can now add ReplayGain data to songs and thus ensure the analysis won’t be done over and over again.

This is an _additional_ option to the existing write_tags feature and will only work when `write_tags` is enabled. Based on our file analysis, it will save (and overwrite) ReplayGain Track data, such as the gain value, the reference loudness, integrated loudness and true peak info.

The logic is inside `cue_file`, so it can as well be used for pre-processing your files without the need of other tools. Autocue & ReplayGain—all in one!

The `cue_file` help now shows the file formats it supports, and the tags it knows about. `cue_file` will automatically detect if Mutagen is installed and offer you a whopping **20 more filetypes** to work with!

#### Breaking Changes:

- `liq_true_peak` (in dBFS) has been renamed to `liq_true_peak_db`.
- A new `liq_true_peak` has been added that stores the peak value as expected and needed by ReplayGain.
- Both `cue_file` and `autocue.cue_file.liq` must be updated to v2.0.0 for everything to work correctly.
- It is advisable to install Mutagen on the system running Liquidsoap, or in the AzuraCast Docker container. Doing this gets you more file and tag types you can work with, and safer/more compatible tagging. Mutagen can usually be installed with `pip3 install mutagen` (preferred), or `sudo apt install python3-mutagen` (often older versions, distros don’t update that often).


### 2024-06-04 – v1.2.3

First public version with a numbering scheme. We use SemVer:

- MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- MAJOR increments when API-breaking changes are released.
- MINOR increments with new functionality compatible with the existing API.
- PATCH increments when API-compatible bugfixes and minor changes are done.

The version numbers of `autocue.cue_file` and the external `cue_file` binary should usually be the same.

Introducing:

- Mutagen (Pyhon tagging library) should be installed and allows writing tags to _many_ file and tagging formats.
- ffmpeg is now only used for tagging where we know it’s safe.
- Much better error checking:
  - Writing tags only to "known good" file types.
  - Gracefully skip writing to write-protected files/folders/drives.
  - `cue_file` has got better CLI params checking and much improved help.

### 2024-05-21

- First released built-in implementation in _AzuraCast_ Rolling Release \#caeea9d.

### 2024-04-19

In preparation for later merge with `master` branch:

- Rename `autocue2.liq` to `autocue.cue_file.liq`.
- Rename `test_local.liq` to `test_autocue.cue_file.liq`.
- Use same `cue_file` as in `master` branch, update `autocue.cue_file.liq`.
- Add settings to `test_autocue.cue_file.liq` so `autocue` does the right thing (hopefully).

### 2024-04-10

- Started a CHANGELOG.md, so interested parties can follow.
- Streamlined `autocue2` code, removed unnecessary stuff.
- Change and solidify metadata handling. It now ensures that:
  - Metadata seen in both `autocue2:` protocol and `enable_autocue2_metadata()` mode.
  - All "processing flags" always seen, like
    - `liq_autocue2`
    - `liq_blankskip`
    - `jingle_mode`
  - `replaygain_track_gain` & `liq_amplify` always unified when `settings.autocue2.unify_loudness_correction` is `true`. ReplayGain, if it exists, takes precedence.
  - All possible combinations of `enable_autocue2_metadata()`, `autocue2:` protocol, and `annotate:` actually work correctly. It is still considered a user error if `enable_autocue2_metadata()` is used in conjunction with `autocue2:`, since this would invoke processing _twice_.
  - _Priorities_ are always respected, so the user can _override_ automatically calculated values using _tags_ in the files, _annotations_ or _AzuraCast’s Visual Cue Editor_, for example. Priorities are, from lowest to highest:
    - Calculated values from `cue_file`/`autocue2`.
    - `liq_*` and `replaygain_track_gain` as _tags_ in the audio file.
    - Annotated settings like `liq_blankskip=false`. These include all settings coming from _AzuraCast’s Visual Cue Editor_ and _Advanced Edit Media_ settings.

You can now do really wild things, like enabling `autocue2` processing globally, and _still_ create something like a "sampling" playlist which plays 30s-snippets of a list of songs. And even with the simplest crossfade command possible!

```ruby
enable_autocue2_metadata()

...

radio = playlist(
  prefix='annotate:liq_cue_in=30.,liq_cue_out=60.,liq_cross_duration=2.5:',
  'Classic Rock.m3u'
)

radio = crossfade(radio, fade_in=0.1, fade_out=2.5)
```

Or you can _exclude_ your video files from processing, for example:

```ruby
video_playlist_night = playlist(
  id="video_playlist_night",
  prefix="annotate:liq_autocue2=false:",
  mode="randomize", reload_mode="watch", videos_night_folder)
```

The sky is the limit!
